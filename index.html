									<b>From March 2015 – to July 2017 with TATA Consultancy Services Ltd, as a Systems
										Engineer</b> <br />

								<ul>Key Results Area:
									<li>
										Maintaining the UAT environments in good health, which ensures smooth testing in
										UAT
										environments.
									</li>

									<li>
										Writing scripts for automation requirements, depending on the operating system
										appropriate scripting language was used.
									</li>
									<li>
										Continuous Deployment and Integration of new code, implementing the agile
										methodology principles.
									</li>
									<li>
										Coordinating with other teams in case of issues and bringing the environments up
										as
										soon as possible to avoid any downtime for testers.
									</li>
									<li>
										Writing web-based automation scripts using languages like Python and Perl with
										frameworks like (CGI).
									</li>
									<li>
										Writing scripts for Geneos server monitoring tool, which helps in automating the
										monitoring of the server health.
									</li>
								</ul>

								<ul>Accomplishments:
									<li>
										Automated health check of environments: A Python script was written to reduce
										manual
										efforts put in daily tasks, which are performed on a daily basis before
										releasing it
										to testers for testing. The script checks if all the process is running fine
										which
										is required for testing purposes and for any other issues. Depending on the
										state of
										the environment, the script drops the mail to the concerned authority.
									</li>
									<li>
										Automated checking of server space and conditional copying: A script was written
										that runs on a centralized server. The script logs in to several servers
										periodically and checks for the servers where
										space is near the critical limit. On finding any critical server the script
										automatically moves the large files which are generated on a daily basis to a
										centralized repository.ß
